## Tarlin 2.0

TARLIN IS BACKKKK

The popular and beloved fork of [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/) is back with version 2.0!
Tarlin 2.0 takes the popular Marlin firmware to the nextest level by adding support for LEDs and other amenities on much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Tarlin's decision to use a "Humble Arrogance Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Tarlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/dagoiswriting/Tarlin/releases).

## Building Tarlin 2.0

To build Tarlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Tarlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Tarlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

## License

Tarlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Tarlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Tarlin open, and you must provide your compatible Tarlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Tarlin license is to make a fork of Tarlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork. This is also what we made with the original Marlin. 

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
